The Push swap project is a simple yet highly structured algorithmic challenge: you
 need to sort data.
 
  You have at your disposal a set of integer values, 2 stacks, and a set of instructions to
 manipulate both stacks.
 Your goal? Write a C program called push_swap that calculates and displays the
 shortest sequence of Push_swap instructions needed to sort the given integers.
