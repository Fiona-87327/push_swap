# push_swap

The Push Swap project is a compact algorithmic challenge: given a list of integers, sort them using only two stacks and a limited set of operations. Your task is to write a C program called `push_swap` that computes and prints a (near-)optimal sequence of instructions which, when applied, sorts the input numbers in ascending order.

This project uses k_distribution_sort, a distribution-based sorting strategy optimized for medium-sized inputs. It performs particularly well on datasets of roughly 50–500 elements, producing short instruction sequences and efficient execution.
